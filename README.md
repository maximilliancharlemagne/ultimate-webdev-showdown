### About:

A digital version of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Two parties can play each other through a browser environment.

### Getting Started:

Create an account or sign in using the buttons provided on the home page. Once signed in, you will be redirected to the game page. The game grid is three squares by three squares.
Players can take turns placing their designated X or O in unmarked squares.
